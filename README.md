cu_tt
=====

CUDA tree traversal library

Place this in NVIDIA_CUDA_SDK/C/src. Type "make" in the top level of the CUDA SDK (it's okay if it fails, it just needs to build some common files), then type "make" in this project directory (NVIDIA_CUDA_SDK/C/src/cu_tt). Finally, run it from the binary output path, which will be something like "../../bin/linux/release/simple_tt"
